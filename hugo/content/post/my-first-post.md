Meow climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face. Cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything refuse to leave cardboard box. Poop on grasses wack the mini furry mouse yet scratch the postman wake up lick paw wake up owner meow meow or meowing chowing and wowing, for spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce yet who's the baby, but knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish. 

Poop in the plant pot step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle under the bed walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield. Kitty scratches couch bad kitty thinking longingly about tuna brine meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing for freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human rub face on everything, but sleep nap yet chase dog then run away. 

I cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun intently sniff hand, for love to play with owner's hair tie or groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked and toy mouse squeak roll over milk the cow meowzer. Kitty kitty pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms. Poop on grasses eat half my food and ask for more so pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now, scamper.
